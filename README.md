My Home-Assistant Setup
=======================

This Home Assistant configuration files are used mostly to control my energy mangament system.
If you are interested in those topics it would most sense if you have a PV installation which you can control via HA and/or
an Electric Vehicle, with a controllable plug. 
In my case I use or have connected the following hardware connected to HA.

- Heating: Mitsubishi Ecodan Heat pump with Z-Wave thermostats

- Solar / PV: Victron Energy Multiplus connected via modbus
- EV Charging: Plug with contactor controlled over Z-Wave
- Ventilation: Controlled over Z-Wave relais
